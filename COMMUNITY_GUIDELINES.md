# Platform Engineering Community Guidelines

Welcome to the [Platform Engineering Community](http://www.platformengineering.org "Platform Engineering Community"). 

This is a dedicated space for you to network with others, expand your knowledge and ask questions about Platform Engineering.
You could be here to find a job, an answer to a problem, to inquire about a tool or study a use case for building your platform.

Our mission is to nurture and grow the [Platform Engineering Community](http://www.platformengineering.org "Platform Engineering Community") and we are committed to hosting a space where our actions align with our vision and purpose. 

We developed the following community guidelines to provide guidance on how to engage with other users in the community and what you should expect from others. 

*These guidelines are first and foremost useful for the Community, so the Community will be the main actor responsible for manteinance and continuous review. Everyone is welcome to participate in this document and comment/ask for changes.*

## The PE Slack Channel

The Slack channel is the main community platform. With more than 8000 people participating (Dec 2022), it represents a good picture of the current
platform engineering community.

The basic rules for the Slack channel in regards to promotion and product are: 
* Things you can do: Post links to your own website/product, promote your talks, promote your meetups, connect with others in the allocated spaces as specified below.
* Things you can't do: Only post self-promotional posts/comments; send unsolicited private messages to members about your self-promotional content; use redirects to obfuscate your self-promotional content.

It is comprised of a list of channels that are represented down below (*this list is not complete and is ever-changing dependent on community wishes*):

**Generic - Community leaders led:**

* *general*: this channel scope is to drive conversations, ask questions and discuss recent trends in the community or in the industry. It should be free of product-focussed conversations, conferences CTAs and sales-y pitches. 
* *intros*: this channel is for presenting yourself and your role when first entering the community. 
* *jobs*: this channel scope is to post job ads or to look for a job.
* *local chapters*: these channels are community-led and populated and should promote local meetups and interactions in the community. A pinned message will collect all the local chapters already open. It will be updated monthly.
