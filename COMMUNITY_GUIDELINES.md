## Community Guidelines

Welcome to the Platform Engineering Community. 

We are happy to offer a dedicated space for you to network with others, expand your knowledge and ask questions about Platform Engineering.
You could be here to find a job, an answer to a problem, to inquire about a tool or study a use case for building your platform.

Our mission is to nurture and grow the Platform Engineering Community and we are committed to hosting a space where our actions align 
with our vision and purpose. 

We developed the following community guidelines to provide guidance on how to engage with other users in the community 
and what you should expect from others. 

These guidelines are first and foremost useful for the Community, so the Community will be the main actor responsible for manteinance and repurpose. 

##The Slack Channel
